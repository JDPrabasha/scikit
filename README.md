# Scikit-learn Projects
 Welcome!\
 \
This is where I store all of the datasets and notebooks I use to practice with scikit-learn, a free software machine learning library for Python. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy (to quote Wikipedia).
\
\
All datasets are ones I've found after looking through the internet for specific datasets that would help me practice with a specific algorithm/set of algorithms, as well as gain experience with Pandas, a data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
\
\
You are completely free to use the datasets as you please, as well as go through my notebooks to see how I've implemented varoius algorithms using particular datasets. Click through the links below to go through the associated notebooks.
